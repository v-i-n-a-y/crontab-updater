# Crontab Updater

Just laziness, can really be used to generate any crontab jobs, I just called it updater cause I use it ensure my family's computers are updated

Usage:

- Run "./install.sh"
- Choose the commands you want
- It adds the crontab

NOTE:

- Old crontabs saved
- Create a update.log file in the user's home directory
- Can add other commands you would like
